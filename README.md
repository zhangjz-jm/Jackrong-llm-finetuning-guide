## 🏛️ About This Project

This repository is designed as a **"Zero to One"** learning platform. Whether you have zero technical background or are an experienced developer, you will find reproducible, end-to-end guides that walk you through the entire lifecycle of large language models. Starting from simply registering a Google account and opening Colab, you will learn how to efficiently adapt models to your specific domain needs.

### ✨ Key Features & Offerings

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🛤️ **0-to-1 Learning Path** | Step-by-step guides starting from the absolute basics, requiring nothing more than a browser and a free cloud environment. |
| 🔄 **Diverse Training Workflows** | Codebases covering Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and foundational setups for Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other advanced paradigms. |
| ⚡ **Resource-Efficient Engineering** | Leveraging tools like Unsloth and 4-bit quantization to run large-scale training within single-GPU constraints (e.g., standard Google Colab). |
| 📦 **End-to-End Delivery** | From multi-source data normalization to LoRA adaptation, merged 16-bit exports, and GGUF quantization for local deployment. |

## 💡 A Message to Builders

> [!NOTE]
> *"For beginners, hobbyists, and anyone curious about AI: this path is learnable."*

The purpose of this document is not only to describe one training run, but also to communicate a broader message: fine-tuning, post-training, and even moderate-scale pretraining are **not inaccessible technical rituals**. They are **engineering practices** that can be learned, reproduced, and gradually mastered. With open-source models, public datasets, cloud compute platforms, and an increasingly mature training toolchain, what you often need is simply a Google account, a regular laptop, and sustained curiosity.

As a learner who also started from zero, I understand the uncertainty many newcomers face: environment setup complexity, opaque hyperparameters, and anxiety about compute resources often become the first barrier to entry. This is exactly why optimization toolchains such as Unsloth matter: by improving training efficiency and resource utilization, they substantially lower the practical threshold for large-model fine-tuning, turning what once required expensive hardware and specialized experience into something ordinary developers can attempt and master.

**In that sense, we all have the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants, understand models, adapt models, and give them new capabilities.**

*No one starts as an expert. But every expert was once brave enough to begin.*

## 🚀 Upcoming Model Support & Roadmap

In the near future, this repository will continuously expand its support for the latest state-of-the-art open-source model families. The upcoming tutorials and codebases will comprehensively cover both **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL - specifically GRPO)** pipelines.

Below is the planned support matrix for upcoming model families:

| Model Family | SFT Support | RL (GRPO) Support |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Qwen 3.5** | ✅ Released | Scheduled |
| **Qwen 3** | Scheduled | Scheduled |
| **Llama3.2 (3B)** | ✅ Included | ✅ Released |
| **Llama** (3.1 / 3.3) | Scheduled | Scheduled |
| **Phi-4** | Scheduled | Scheduled |
| **Gemma 4** | Scheduled | Scheduled |
| **DeepSeek** | Scheduled | Scheduled |

## 📚 High-Fidelity Distillation Datasets

High-quality data is the engine of effective model adaptation. In parallel with our training code, this repository provides access to **24 curated, high-fidelity datasets** specifically collected and distilled to enhance model reasoning, coding, and conversational capabilities.

These datasets are primarily distilled from state-of-the-art flagship models (such as *DeepSeek-V3.2*, *Qwen3-235B*, *GLM-4.7*, and *GPT-OSS-120B*) and follow advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) formatting. 

**Key Dataset Categories Included:**
*   🧠 **Reasoning & CoT (Chain-of-Thought):** Datasets like `Jackrong/Qwen3.5-reasoning-700`, `Jackrong/Natural-Reasoning-gpt-oss-120B-S1`, and `Jackrong/glm-4.7-multiturn-CoT` designed to improve step-by-step logic and deduction.
*   📐 **Mathematics & STEM:** Specialized data such as `DeepSeek-v3.1-reasoner-Distilled-math-samples` and focused domain knowledge like `Jackrong/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-Distilled-chat`.
*   💻 **Code & Algorithms:** Collections like `Competitive-Programming-python-blend` and `qwen3-coder-480b-distill-mini` to strengthen competitive programming and algorithmic generation.
*   💬 **Instruction & Multi-turn Chat:** Resources like `Jackrong/LogicMind-Chat-Reasoning-SFT-300K`, `Chinese-Qwen3-235B-Thinking-2507-Distill-100k`, and `ShareGPT-gpt-oss-120B-reasoning` focused on human alignment, IELTS writing feedback, and robust conversational flowing.

*All datasets are open-sourced on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/Jackrong). You can also use the included `download_datasets.py` script to batch download the entire suite for local training.*

## 🌍 Open Source Commitment & Community Impact

Moving forward, the complete training source code for every fine-tuned model I release on Hugging Face will be fully open-sourced in this repository. My goal is to ensure that anyone—regardless of their background or resources—can freely download, execute, and learn from these scripts to build their own AI capabilities.

I am deeply grateful for the community's support. The Qwen3.5 fine-tunes I shared on Hugging Face have recently reached over a **million downloads**—a quiet reminder of the power of open knowledge. It is my sincere hope that making these full training pipelines publicly available will encourage more developers to start their own fine-tuning journeys.
